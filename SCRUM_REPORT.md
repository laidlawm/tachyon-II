# Scrum Report

## Sprint #1:

### Scrum Leader: Matthew Laidlaw
### Sprint Goal: Compile list of components required to boot Linux on the PolarFire Icicle Kit.
The specifications of the Tachyon II require it to be quite small. In order to fit into the given specification, the hardware team must remove components from the supplied Icicle Kit. However, it is important that the board remains able to boot Linux. So, we cannot remove *any* component important to the Linux bootflow.
### Product Log:
* Boot Linux on the board
* Investigate the on-board Linux OS
* Research Microchip/MicroSemi documentation on the PolarFire Icicle Kit
* Create list of minimum required components to boot Linux
### Member Tasks:
* (All) - Use the getting started documentation to boot Linux on the board and learn the software tools required to interact with the device (SoftConsole, FlashProExpress)
* Matthew - Investigate the Linux OS on the device and the information printed during the boot process to observe where the kernel and root filesystem live. Communicate list of components to project partner / hardware team.
* Logan - Investigate the documentation provided by Microchip/MicroSemi in order to understand which components on the board are needed.
### Scrum Record:
The team had a little bit of trouble ramping up on this task, and there was a small lapse in communication between us and our project partner. Though, we were able to iron out the minimum required list of components. Our project partner reached out to the manufacturers of the Icicle Kit to verify if the list of components would be enough to boot Linux. We were also able to ramp up on the hardware and software tools necessary to work with this device.
